Doubling the size of the underlying array is a terrible idea if it is for any real world application. Doubling the array leads to wasted storage
and memory, and ultimately leads towards heavier code than necessary. Say you only need three more slots in your already sizable array of say 50, you now have
(after duplicating the initial array) 47 open slots that may never be used, and is just taking up time and memory for even being created in the first place.
This doesn't even take into account that with all the open spots, the old array will be copied into the new one, but everything will be wildly spaced out due
to the now extra 47 spots available, which just isn't good in practice.
